        "**Q1.** Please answer the following questions in your own words.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. How are trees constructed?\n",
        "\n",
        "The basic idea of building a tree is starting with a population and splitting the data into groups with the goal of the instances in those final, narrowed-down groups being the most similar to eachother. At each level of the tree it is determined True or False whether an instance has a certain feature or a certain value of numerical variable and this creates a split.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. How do trees handle non-linear relationships between variables? Compare this to linear models.\n",
        "\n",
        "Trees split the data based on certain \"cutoffs\" for each variable so there is no assumed shape of the correlation between certain variables. Each variable determines the best split at each level of the tree, so the more important aspect is the threshold used for the cutoff rather than just the overall variable itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Why is the Gini a good loss function for categorical target variables?\n",
        "\n",
        "Our goal is to create groups that are as pure (extremely different) as possible and the Gini measures that level of purity. Gini impurity is measured by computing x(1-x) for each group created by each threshold, and sum over each cutoff group. The split with the lowest Gini impurity is the best split. It is a good loss function because it helps to pick the best split.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Why do trees tend to overfit, and how can this tendency be constrained?\n",
        "\n",
        "Trees have a tendency to overfit because they can keep splitting until each terminal node of the tree has too few or even just 1 overly specific sample. This would show that the tree has overfit to the data. One way to constrain this tendency would be to limit the depth of the tree before it gets to the point of overfitting. Other options include putting a lower bound on impurity so that terminal nodes don't get too pure, or put a limit on how few cases can appear in a terminal node.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. True or false, and explain: Trees only really perform well in situations with lots of categorical variables as features/covariates.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although it is good to have lots of categorical variables for this type of model, I would say this statement is false because trees can perform well for regression as well. One could definitely choose valuable thresholds for numerical values which can perform well when doing splits.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why don't most versions of classification/regression tree concept allow for more than two branches after a split?\n",
        "\n",
        "Having only two branch options for a split makes it simpler to keep track of how splits occur, how good the split is, and overall is easier to interpret the results.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What are some heuristic ways you can examine a tree and decide whether it is probably over- or under-fitting?\n",
        "\n",
        "A tree is probably overfitting if terminal nodes have very small amounts or even just 1 in the sample size. If computed impurity values of groups are high and the tree is very shallow it may be underfitting."
